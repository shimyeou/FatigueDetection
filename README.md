## Background
Babcock is a global defence and engineering company that provides critical services to civil and military
sectors, including a range of maritime sustainment services. Worker fatigue within these fast-paced
environments poses a significant risk in decision making capability, and resultant worker safety. While
training exists, thereâ€™s no effective way to monitor fatigue in real time. This project proposes a
proof-of-concept tool using computer vision and machine learning to address this gap.

## Problem
Workplace fatigue poses a safety, productivity and operational
risk for workers within a maritime maintenance environment.
Although training is provided, there is no reliable way to monitor
fatigue in real time. This project develops a proof-of-concept tool
using computer vision and machine learning to detect early
signs of fatigue at fixed workstations, aiming to enhance safety,
reduce errors, and support proactive wellbeing measures.

## Key Features
1. Eye aspect ration (EAR)
2. Mouth aspect ratio (MAR)
3. DeepFace for face recognition
4. Visual indicators and alerts for drowsy behavior
5. Long session monitoring with time-based filtering
6. Automic generation aof fatigue event logs and excel reports


## Technologies used
Python, OpenCV, dlib, DeepFace, YOLOv5
